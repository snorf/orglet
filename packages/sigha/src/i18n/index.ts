/**
 * Locale plumbing for every user-facing string in the app.
 *
 * All prose lives in locale packs; `en/` is the reference pack and the
 * source of truth for the catalog's shape. Code never embeds user-visible
 * English — it calls `t()` (or the registry helpers below) at the point
 * where the text is produced. Interpolated messages are plain typed
 * functions, so each locale controls its own word order and pluralization
 * without an ICU dependency.
 *
 * i18n sits at the very bottom of the dependency graph: every layer may
 * import it, and it imports nothing from the rest of src/.
 *
 * Diagnostics and simplifier steps render their text eagerly in the active
 * locale; the app recomputes them from source on every edit, so a locale
 * chosen at boot (before first render) is always consistent. Dynamic
 * locale switching would additionally need a re-parse + re-render — see
 * README.md.
