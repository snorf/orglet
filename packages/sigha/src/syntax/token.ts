 * lexeme); structural punctuation gets distinct kinds because the parser
 * branches on them directly. Keyword literals (`TRUE`/`FALSE`/`NULL`) get their
 * own kinds because they map to distinct AST literal nodes.
 *
 * `"error"` is emitted for characters the lexer cannot classify — lexing never
 * throws (DESIGN §3.1), so unknown input becomes a token.
 * `"eof"` is a zero-width sentinel that always terminates the stream and holds
 * any trailing trivia.

 * the surrounding formula parseable — the run is diagnosed once, with a fix,
